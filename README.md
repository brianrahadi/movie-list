## What is this?
A Movie app that lets you see movies in various categories (popular, top rated, upcoming, any genres). You can also search the movie with the search bar provided. The data of movies is provided from The Movie Database (TMDB) API. This website is built with React-hooks, React-Bootstrap, and Axios.

## Further Improvements
- Need to add pagination so it lets you to see more movies
- More stylish website :)

I learned all about react from this course. This course is explained in a very simple way even though it does not get too advanced.

I learned the basic of TMDB API from this course. From there, I created the entire website from scratch with React, Bootstrap, and Axios

## Personal Notes
Learning React is very fun. The code is much more beautiful than building a website with vanilla JS. I intend to update this website so it has the features provided from further improvements.
