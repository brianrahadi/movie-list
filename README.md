## What is this?
A Movie app that lets you see movies in various categories (popular, top rated, upcoming, any genres). You can also search the movie with the search bar provided. The data of movies is provided from The Movie Database (TMDB) API. This website is built with React-hooks, React-Bootstrap, and Axios.

## Further Improvements
- Need to add pagination so it lets you to see more movies
- More stylish website :)

## Personal Notes
Learning React is very fun. The code is much more beautiful than building a website with vanilla JS. That being said, I intend to create a more complex website that has a proper backend to it.
